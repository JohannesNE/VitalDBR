# VitalDBR
The aim of this repo is to build an R package to do statistical analysis on the [VitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/) dataset. We want to build a well documented easy to use R-package for practioners interested in extracting information from the open [VitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/) dataset. The focus will be on using GAMSs to model the pulse pressure variation of anaesthesia patients undergoing various surgeries, but we will also present useful functions to create plots and import data. Finally we will do a statistical analysis on the data to explore if pulse pressure variation impacts the amount of days that patients spend in the ICU.

Our project can be found in the file "vignette.html" if you just want to read or "vignette.rmd" if you want to run the code yourself. Many of the functions used in the vignette are located in the file at "VitalDBR -> R -> VitalDBR.r"

The package is made as a part of the course "Data Project" at Aarhus University, 2022.
