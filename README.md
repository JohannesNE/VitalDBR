# VitalDBR
The aim of this repo is to build an R package to do statistical analysis on the [VitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/) dataset. We want to build a well documented easy to use R-package for practioners interested in extracting information from the open [VitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/) dataset. The focus will be on using GAMS's to model the pulse pressure variation of anaesthesia patients undergoing various surgeries, but we will also present useful functions to create plots and import data.  

The package is made as a part of the course "Data Project" at Aarhus University, 2022.
